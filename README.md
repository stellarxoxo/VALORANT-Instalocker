# VALORANT-Instalocker
Locks agents before the game even starts to load, made in less than an hour

To use this with your own agents, edit the CONFIG and REGION near the top of the code
```py
CONFIG = {
    'Ascent': "Jett",
    'Pearl': "Jett",
    'Haven': "Cypher",
    'Split': "Jett",
    'Icebox': "Reyna",
    'Fracture': "Harbor",
    'Lotus': "Breach",
}

REGION = "na"
```

## Notes
- If your region is LATAM or BR then set your shard to NA, otherwise have region and shard be the same
- Regions: na, latam, eu, ap, br, kr
